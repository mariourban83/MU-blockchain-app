1. Create Blockchain and Block (as module) classes
2. Define data included in the block : timestamp, last_hash, hash, data
3. Create mine_block function and genesis-first block in the chain
4. Add mine_block and genesis function as a static method within the Block class
5. Create crypto_hash function for hashing any data with hashlib and json python libraries
6. Modify cryptohash function, so it accepts any parameters in any order

7. Activate python venv - virtual environment and install pytest module
8. Create requirements.txt with list of required modules
9. Refactor and reorganize code into folders and modules
10. Write tests for Block and Blockchain classes and for crypto_hash function
11. Add difficulty and nonce values for proof of work algorithm
12. Create a function for adjusting difficulty value based on the mine_rate value
